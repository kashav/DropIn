The student considering taking this course would typically plan to pursue a career in small business started by him/herself, or in a family enterprise. The skills acquired, however, are very useful in any business where a graduate might end up in his/her career, without the need for actually being an entrepreneur. Our approach to teaching is based on real-life business experiences and many years of successful practice of “what we preach”. The course contains very little theoretical work or academic approaches. It is designed to familiarise you with the kinds of opportunities (problems) likely to be encountered in an entrepreneurial career. If you really want this lifestyle and are prepared to work hard, we will provide you with the practical knowledge and technical skills required to pursue this kind of career. Topics covered in this course include: Marketing and Sales; Legal issues; Financing the business; Human Resources challenges, the Business Plan and many other issues. Note that the course material may be adjusted between the two courses as required. We recognize the value of communication skills in both the classroom and in project reports. In fact, we require that you learn how to present yourself in a business-like manner. As and when appropriate, outside visitors from the business community will join in and contribute to the class discussions. The course deals with practical concepts, actual past and current events and is presented from the point of view of someone who has “done it all”. This means that what you hear is the real stuff. There will be several assignments and the preparation of a full Business Plan as the session project.

This course will combine linear control theory, physiology, and neuroscience with the objective of explaining how these complex systems operate in a healthy human body. The first part of the course will provide an introduction into physiology and give an overview of the main physiological systems. The second part of the course will focus on the endocrine system and its subsystems, including glucose regulation, thyroid metabolic hormones, and the menstrual cycle. The third part of the course will include discussion on the cardiovascular system and related aspects such as cardiac output, venous return, control of blood flow by the tissues, and nervous regulation of circulation.

This course will provide a framework for identifying and resolving problems in a complex, unstructured decision-making environment. It will give students the opportunity to apply a problem identification framework through real world case studies. The case studies will involve people from the health care industry bringing current practical problems to the class. Students work in small groups preparing a feasibility study discussing potential approaches. Although the course is directed at Industrial Engineering fourth year and graduate students, it does not assume specific previous knowledge, and the course is open to students in other disciplines.","meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":["M Carter"],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":43200,"end":50400,"duration":7200,"location":"GB 405"},{"day":"THURSDAY","start":43200,"end":46800,"duration":3600,"location":"GB 405"}],"size":80,"enrolment":34},{"code":"T0101","instructors":["M Carter"],"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":32400,"end":39600,"duration":7200,"location":"GB 405"}],"size":80,"enrolment":31}]},{"id":"MIE570H1S20171","code":"MIE570H1S","name":"SPECIAL TOPICS IN MEC.
